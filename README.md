### Challenge 2: Manejo de Archivos

To complete Challenge 2 for the course, I have implemented the necessary functionality using ECMAScript classes and advanced features with the file system library included in nodejs. The code for this challenge can be found in the appropriate files.

## Running the Project with npm

To run the project using npm, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the root directory of the project.
2. Run the command `npm run start`.
3. The project should now be running on your local server.

If you encounter any issues while running the project, check the project's documentation or contact the developer for assistance.

This deliverable includes the following:

- A ProductManager class that can be found in the index.js file. The class includes the following methods:
  - addProduct
  - getProducts
  - getProductById
  - updateProduct
  - deleteProduct
  
  The code for these methods has been implemented using ECMAScript classes and advanced features.
  
- Basic tests for the ProductManager class and its methods. The tests have been written in plain javascript but have not been implemented using a testing framework yet.
